WaterBalance scripts

To be run with WaterBalance package, located in another repository.  

1. After running cliamte futures, run Daily_WB_batch_v2.
    Reads in MACA CF data and site parameters (must calculate separately)
    Calculates daily WB (Hamon) and plots in same script.
    For Biome plot to work, direct to D_AET_points.csv
    
2. Previous versions of scripts located in Climate-Plots-Variations/Old-WB-scripts folder. These have not been updated nor tested, so will need troubleshooting and debugging.
